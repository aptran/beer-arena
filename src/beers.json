At least one regional combination of ingredients and\/or techniques must be unique and differentiated from ingredients and\/or techniques commonly used by brewers throughout the world.  There are many excellent and popular beers that are brewed with either non-traditional or traditional ingredients and\/or processes yet their character may distinctively vary from all other styles currently defined or included in these guidelines. These grain-based beers are brewed reflecting local beer culture (process, ingredients, climate, etc.). This category recognizes uniquely local or regional beer types and beers distinctively not defined in any recognized style in these guidelines. They may be light or dark, strong or weak, hoppy or not hoppy. They may have characters which are unique to yeast, fermentation techniques, aging conditions, carbonation level - or higher or lower levels of profound characters normally associated with other beer types. Examples of indigenous beers might include current day versions of highly regional and\/or historic styles which are not represented elsewhere in these guidelines, such as Finnish-style sahti, S American chicha, African sorghum based beers, and others. Other examples might include beers made wholly unique by use of multiple local ingredients and\/or techniques, with the resulting beer being highly representative of location, as well as differentiated from traditional beer style categories. Beers brewed with non-traditional hop varieties, grains, malt, yeast or other ingredient that still closely approximate an existing classical category would be more appropriately entered into the classical category. New and innovative beers that do not represent locally adopted techniques or grown ingredients would be more appropriately entered into the experimental category. Proper evaluation of entries in this category requires the need to provide  judges with additional information about the beer.  A written summary illustrating the intent, background, history, design and\/or development of the beer as well as  describing any regional and\/or stylistic context, choice of ingredients, process and any other unique information, helps establish a basis for comparison between highly diverse entries. Entering brewers must provide a statement of 100 words or less illustrating the above and why it is an indigenous beer without revealing the company's identity. This statement should be carefully crafted and will be evaluated by judges and carry significant weight in their decisions. Statements that contain information which might identify or otherwise create bias towards the entry will be modified by the Competition Manager. Entries not accompanied by this information will be at a profound disadvantage during judging.","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 15:45:15"}},{"id":"kWXWGC","name":"1812 Amber Ale","nameDisplay":"1812 Amber Ale","description":"Awarded a Silver Medal in the World Beer Championships in the Amber Ale category for 1998, this is our flagship ale.

The Bow Brewery became the dominant shipper of the lighter style beer to India, mostly because of its close proximity to the East India Company docks on the River Thames. Lady Luck strikes again. \r\n\r\nThe Addlehead IPA formula calls for a blending of 5 grains and 3 hops to produce a beer that IPA devotees appreciate but others also find pleasantly tasty. \r\n\r\nAddlehead has a golden yellow color and a full, rich body with a creamy head and a medium lace. It is rated at 95 IBU (International Bitterness Units), but it has a balanced hint of sweetness which is rare in an IPA. \r\n\r\nMost importantly, it retains the signature IPA hoppy finish.","abv":"7.4","ibu":"95","availableId":1,"styleId":30,"isOrganic":"Y","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/hdoR8f\/upload_VZx7Ck-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/hdoR8f\/upload_VZx7Ck-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/hdoR8f\/upload_VZx7Ck-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2015-06-18 20:34:14","updateDate":"2015-12-18 01:39:55","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":30,"categoryId":3,"category":{"id":3,"name":"North American Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:45"},"name":"American-Style India Pale Ale","shortName":"American IPA","description":"American-style India pale ales are perceived to have medium-high to intense hop bitterness, flavor and aroma with medium-high alcohol content.

A primary difference between Belgian Gueuze and German Gose is that Gose is served at a much younger age. Gose is typically pale gold to pale amber in color and typically contains malted barley, unmalted wheat with some traditional varieties containing oats. Hop character and malt flavors and aromas are negligible. Lemony or other citrus-like qualities are often present in aroma and on the palate. Some versions may have the spicy character of added coriander in aroma and on the palate at low to medium levels. Salt (table salt) character is also traditional in low amounts. Horsey, leathery, earthy aroma and flavors contributed by Brettanomyces yeasts may be evident but have a very low profile, as this beer is not excessively aged. Modern German Gose breweries typically introduce only pure beer yeast strains for fermentation. Low to medium lactic acid character is evident in all examples as sharp, refreshing sourness. Gose is typically enjoyed fresh, carbonated, and cloudy\/hazy with yeast character, and may have evidence of continued fermentation activity. Overall complexity of flavors and aromas are sought while maintaining an ideal balance between acidity, yeast-enhanced spice and refreshment is ideal.","ibuMin":"10","ibuMax":"15","abvMin":"4.4","abvMax":"5.4","srmMin":"3","srmMax":"9","ogMin":"1.036","fgMin":"1.008","fgMax":"1.012","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46","updateDate":"2015-04-07 17:09:35"}},{"id":"lb5nOP","name":"Almanac IPA","nameDisplay":"Almanac IPA","description":"The American two row malt with a hint of German biscuit gives the beer a crystal clear golden color and a brilliant white head.

Inspired by almost everything from Belgium (beer, women, mussels) we thought it would be cool to give our Amber a little Belgian love. So we used a yeast that is ALMOST like a Belgian yeast strain. You'll notice it in the aroma but mostly in the flavor.

While the origin of the name remains shrouded in mystery, it likely relates to the original practice of fermenting the beer on San Francisco\u2019s rooftops in a cool climate. In lieu of ice, the foggy night air naturally cooled the fermenting beer, creating steam off the warm open pans. Once a nickname for any West Coast beer brewed under these conditions, today the name \u201csteam\u201d is a trademark of Anchor Brewing and applies only to the singular process and taste of our flagship brand - San Francisco\u2019s original Anchor Steam\u00ae Beer.

The amazing hop flavor and aroma created by the five different hops are going to remain anonymous. So far nobody has figured them out. This brave new beer is brewed by and for innovators. Go ahead.

A spicy, fruity-estery aroma and flavor are typical but at low levels; however, phenolic, clove-like characteristics should not be perceived. Color is straw to amber, and the body should be light to medium in character. Diacetyl should not be perceived. If this style is packaged and served without yeast, no yeast characters should be evident in mouthfeel, flavor, or aroma. A low level of tannin derived astringency may be perceived. If this style is served with yeast, the character should portray a full yeasty mouthfeel and appear hazy to very cloudy. Yeast flavor and aroma should be low to medium but not overpowering the balance and character of rye and barley malt and hops. Darker versions of this style will be dark amber to dark brown, and the body should be light to medium in character. Roasted malts are optionally evident in aroma and flavor with a low level of roast malt astringency acceptable when appropriately balanced with malt sweetness. Roast malts may be evident as a cocoa\/chocolate or caramel character. Aromatic toffee-like, caramel, or biscuit-like characters may be part of the overall flavor\/aroma profile. As in the lighter colored versions, diacetyl should not be perceived. Competition directors may create specific styles of rye beer, such as Rye Pale Ale or Rye Brown Ale.

Augustijn Ale has a foamy white head that lingers in a very thin layer on top of the beer until the last drop. It has a honey orange color and is cloudy like a gem stone but you can still through the beer enough to see the bubbles.\r\n\r\nSmell. It has the expected Belgian yeast aroma, but with a slight twist like a fresh banana that is ever so slightly green and a hint of cloves. Unexpectedly, however, this beer has a subtle but nice citrus-orange hoppy bouquet. For me, the bouquet did not last until the end, maybe the smell of food overpowered it.  There is also the aroma of sweet barley malt.\r\n\r\nTaste. Augustijn Ale has a barley malt sweetness that is wel balanced by the hop bitterness. The malt flavor is much stronger tasting than is was smelling. The sweetness of the malt is enhanced by the fresh slightly-unripe banana. The clove is more prominent in the flavor probably by the slightly spicy hop flavors. This beer went very well with the baked brie \u201cen brioche\u201d appetizer at the restaurant.\r\n\r\nMouthfeel. Despite being 8% alcohol by volume, this is a medium-bodied beer. From the original gravity of 1.076 and the alcohol content, I calculated the final gravity to be 1.015. Although it is clearly medium-bodied, Augustijn Ale at times seems lighter bodied. This might be due to the high alcohol content and the effervescence. The level of carbonation is pleasant and a touch higher than most North American craft beers that I have drinking lately.\r\n\r\nDrinkability. Except for Belgian witbier, I usually only want a single Belgian beer per session. The flavors are so intense that one is usually enough. Augustijn Ale, so far, is the exception. I think I enjoyed the particular balance of flavors that this beer imparts. It coudl also be the strain of yeast (which I might try harvesting for some homebrew). I found myself craving another glass immediately upon finishing the first glass. I find this to be a much more drinkable Belgian without losing any of the Belgian beer qualities.","abv":"8","glasswareId":6,"availableId":1,"styleId":59,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/fe44im\/upload_0wSbua-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/fe44im\/upload_0wSbua-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/fe44im\/upload_0wSbua-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","servingTemperature":"cool","servingTemperatureDisplay":"Cool - (8-12C\/45-54F)","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:42:43","updateDate":"2015-12-15 22:34:34","glass":{"id":6,"name":"Snifter","createDate":"2012-01-03 02:41:33"},"available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":59,"categoryId":5,"category":{"id":5,"name":"Belgian And French Origin Ales","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"Belgian-Style Tripel","shortName":"Belgian Tripel","description":"Tripels are often characterized by a complex, sometimes mild spicy character.

The very name stresses the distinctive character of this brand as its recipe has no analogues either among Russian or world brands. Baltika \u21164 is a dark drink produced with rye malt, which adds bread flavor and light bitterness to the taste. The Original sort is now steadily popular and has dedicated lovers throughout Russia.\r\nBaltika #4 is traditionally produced only at St. Petersburg brewery. From this place it is taken all over Russia and exported to almost 30 countries of the world.\r\n\r\nBaltika #4 has won a number of top prizes of international professional contests. In September 2004 Baltika #4 was among the 50 top brands of the world by the results of the annual International Beer Challenge Contest. All the brands participating in the contest are divided into 12 classes and are strictly assessed by their flavor and package by the leading experts in brewing. The jury includes both consumers and specialists in marketing and packaging.\r\n\r\nTwo times running, in 2007 and 2008, Baltika #4 won the silver medals of the Australian International Beer Awards Contest in the category of Lager Packaged.\r\n\r\nIn 2008 Baltika #4 Original brought the Company the Gold Medal of the European Beer Star Awards Contest in the category of Red and Amber Beer. This is the top award of one of the most prestigious contests of the world brewing. The contest was organized by the Association of Private Breweries of Germany and the Association of Independent Breweries of Europe. One of the conditions of the participation is strict compliance with the traditional laws of European brewing. The jury of 65 experts in brewing from 16 countries evaluated the available brands in 40 categories. The samples were traditionally tasted by \"blind testing,\" which guaranteed unbiased evaluation.","abv":"5.6","availableId":1,"styleId":83,"isOrganic":"N","labels":{"icon":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/eJUSFw\/upload_4TqhEz-icon.png","medium":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/eJUSFw\/upload_4TqhEz-medium.png","large":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/brewerydbapi\/beer\/eJUSFw\/upload_4TqhEz-large.png"},"status":"verified","statusDisplay":"Verified","createDate":"2014-07-10 14:28:47","updateDate":"2015-12-18 17:44:53","available":{"id":1,"name":"Year Round","description":"Available year round as a staple beer."},"style":{"id":83,"categoryId":7,"category":{"id":7,"name":"European-germanic Lager","createDate":"2012-03-21 20:06:46"},"name":"European-Style Dark \/ M\u00fcnchner Dunkel","shortName":"Euro Dark","description":"These light brown to dark brown beers have a pronounced malty aroma and flavor that dominates over the clean, crisp, moderate hop bitterness.

In February of 2012, Barmen production was moved back to AC Golden Brewing Company in order to make room for more Blue Moon innovations at the Sandlot Brewery.\r\n\r\nBarmen was born of Pete Coors\u2019 desire to brew a German Pilsner that tastes exactly like the great pilsners of northern Germany. The beer was named after Barmen, Germany; birthplace of Adolph Herman Joseph Coors. Barmen is offered in only a few bars and restaurants in and around Golden, CO.\r\n \r\nTo ensure you enjoy the full Barmen experience, bars and restaurants offering Barmen are requested to honor the traditional \u201cGerman Seven-Minute Pour\u201d and to serve the beer in the proper Barmen branded pilsner glass. When properly poured, it should look like this. Feel empowered to send the beer back to the bartender if it isn\u2019t served correctly.\r\n\r\nThis Pilsner pours a golden straw color, with a beautiful cap of fluffy white foam that creates a \u201clace\u201d on the sides of the glass as the beer is drank.\r\n\r\nTrue to the style, Barmen begins with toasty bread and biscuity flavors before being rounded out by the spicy and floral hop flavors that only the Noble varieties can provide.
